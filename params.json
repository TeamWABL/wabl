{"name":"Wabl","tagline":"Wheeled Autonomous Balancing Limb - Inverted Pendulum Controller","body":"This is an undergraduate engineering project at Taylor University.\r\n\r\n### Problem Statement\r\nThe goal of this project is to design and build a wheeled inverted pendulum, balancing about a single axis and limited to one-dimensional translational movement.  Such a pendulum ought to stabilize in both angle and position within a reasonable time frame as well as minimize power consumption.\r\n### Proposal\r\nThis project will involve the use of an LQR control system to drive an electric motor in order to stabilize an intrinsically unstable system. The desired states (pendulum angle, position, and rotational as well as translational velocities) will be acquired and desired inputs computed in discrete time. By making use of state feedback and modern control theory, the full system will be implemented digitally.\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n+ It shall be at least 36‚Äù tall\r\n+ With no external disturbance, it shall maintain a pendulum angle of less than or equal to one degree\r\n+ With no external disturbance, it shall maintain an x position of less than or equal to 5 centimeters from x=0\r\n+ It should have a battery life of at least 1 hour under stable conditions\r\n+ It should have a battery life of at least 15 minutes under continuous duress\r\n+ It shall stop attempting to correct if phi exceeds 25 degrees\r\n+ It shall be able to withstand tipping over without damage that affects operation of the device\r\n+ The motor driver shall remain functional while the unit is running\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n+ Andrew Krock (@ajkrock93)\r\n+ Britton Finley\r\n+ Christopher Shelor\r\n+ Jonathan Wheeler\r\n+ Josiah Steckenrider\r\n+ Stephen Papierski (@stephenpapierski)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
